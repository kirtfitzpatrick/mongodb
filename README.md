# MongoDB Cookbook

Chef cookbook to install and configure MongoDB. At the time it was written 
alternative community driven cookbooks for MongoDB had major bugs and 
fundamental design flaws. This cookbook is limited to replica sets only (as I 
remember). Clustering is not available in this cookbook.
